# Learning Java with codecademy

## Hello World

### Introduction to Java

- Java programs have at least one class and one main() method.
- Each class represents one real-world idea.
- The main() method runs the tasks of the program.

```java
public class HelloWorld {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello World!");
  }
}
```

```shell
> Hello World!
```

### Hello Java File!

- Java files have a `.java` extension
- class names echo file names and are PascalCase
- `System.out.println()` will print a message to console

```java
public class HelloYou {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello Ruth!");
  }
}
```

```shell
> Hello Ruth!
```

### Commenting Code

- // single line comments
- /* multi line comments */

```java
public class Timeline {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello Java!");
    
    System.out.println("You were born in 1995");

    // Sun Microsystems announced the release of Java in 1995
    
    System.out.println("You were created by James Gosling");
    
		/* James Gosling is a Canadian engineer who 
		created Java while working at Sun Microsystems. 
		His favorite number is the square root of 2! */
    
    System.out.println("You are a fun language!");
  }
} 
```

```shell
> Hello Java!
> You were born in 1995
> You were created by James Gosling
> You are a fun language!
```

### Semicolons and Whitespace

- Java does _not_ interpret whitespace
- Java _does_ interpret semicolons.

```
public class LanguageFacts {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Press enter or return on your keyboard after each semicolon!
    
    System.out.println("Java is a class-based language.");System.out.println("Java classes have a 'main' method.");System.out.println("Java statements end with a semicolon.");
  }
}
```

```java
public class LanguageFacts {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Press enter or return on your keyboard after each semicolon!
    
    System.out.println("Java is a class-based language.");
    System.out.println("Java classes have a 'main' method.");
    System.out.println("Java statements end with a semicolon.");
    System.out.println("Programming is doin' the do");
  }
}
```

```shell
> Java is a class-based language.
> Java classes have a 'main' method.
> Java statements end with a semicolon.
> Programming is doin' the do
```

### Compilation: Catching Errors

- Java is a compiled programming language
- the compiler transforms java code (human readable) into byte code (_Java Virtual Machine_ readable)
- Code that does not the compiler checks will not be compiled and produce a list of errors

```java
public class Compiling {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    
    System.out.println("Java is a class-based language.");
    System.out.println("Java classes have a 'main' method.");
    System.out.println("Java statements end with a semicolon.") //;

    System.out.println("Programming is... fun!");
    
  }
}
```

```shell
$ javac Compiling.java
Compiling.java:6: error: ';' expected
  System.out.println("Java statements end with a semicolon.")
                                                             ^

1 error
$ ls
Compiling.java
$
```

### Compilation: Creating Executables

- We can compile a `.java` file from the terminal with `javac FileName.java`
- If successful, this produces an executable class, `FileName.class`
- Run the executable with `java FileName`

```java
public class Compiling {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    
    System.out.println("Java is a class-based language.");
    System.out.println("Java classes have a 'main' method.");
    System.out.println("Java statements end with a semicolon.");

    System.out.println("Programming is... fun!");
    
  }
}
```

```shell
$ ls
Compiling.java
$ javac Compiling.java
$ ls
Compiling.class Compiling.java
$ java Compiling
> Java is a class-based language.
> Java classes have a 'main' method.
> Java statements end with a semicolon.
> 
> Programming is... fun!
$
```

### Java Review: Putting It All Together

0. Define a public class named `Review`.
0. Define the main() method within the curly braces of the Review class.
0. Inside the main() method, write `The main method executes the tasks of the class` as a single-line comment.
0. Below the comment, write a statement that prints the following: `My first Java program from scratch!`.


```Java
public class Review {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
  	// The main method executes the tasks of the class
    System.out.println("My first Java program from scratch!");
  }
}
```
```shell
> My first Java program from scratch!
```

### Java Program Structure

- java is case-sensitive
- classes are pascal case, methods and variables are camel case
- curly braces mark the scope of a class `{}`
- every program has a `main()` method which holds all of the program instructions
- objects are packages of state and behavior
- `System` is an object responsible for representing our computer within the program

## Variables

### Introduction

- Declaring a variable requires that we specify the type and name
- Types include `int`, `double`, `char` and, `boolean` - all primitives
- To assign a value to a variable, use the assignment operator `=`

> :pencil: Print out the `name` and the `yearCreated` variables:

```java
public class Creator {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
    String name = "James Gosling";
    int yearCreated = 1995;
    
    System.out.println(name);
    System.out.println(yearCreated);
	}
}
```

```shell
> James Gosling
> yearCreated
```

### ints

- In Java, whole numbers are stored in the int primitive data type
- `ints` hold positive numbers, negative numbers, and zero: between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647, inclusive
- They do not store _fractions_ or numbers with _decimals_ in them

> :pencil: Declare a variable that stores the number of comments in the program, then print it to console:

```java
//This is the class declaration
public class CountComment {
  //This is the main method that runs when you compile
	public static void main(String[] args) {
    //This is where you will define your variable
    int numComments = 6;
    //This is where you will print your variable
    System.out.println(numComments);
	}
  
  //This is the end of the class
}

//This is outside the class
```

```shell
> 6
```

### doubles

- `double` can hold decimals and, very large and very small numbers
- The maximum value is 1.797,693,134,862,315,7 E+308, which is approximately 17 followed by 307 zeros
- The minimum value is 4.9 E-324, which is 324 decimal places

> :pencil: Create a variable to hold the % market share of Android phones, then print it:

```java
public class MarketShare {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
    double androidShare = 81.7;
    System.out.println(androidShare);
	}
}
```

```shell
> 81.7
```

### booleans

- it's for booleans!

### char

- The char data type can hold any character, like a letter, space, or punctuation mark
- Use single quotes `'`

> :pencil: Create a variable `expectedGrade` fill it with your grade on this java course:

```java
public class Char {
	public static void main(String[] args) {   
		char expectedGrade = 'A';
    System.out.println(expectedGrade);
	}
}
```

```shell
> A
```

### Strings

- `String`s are objects with built-in behavior

### Static Checking

- Java is _statically typed_
- The program will not compile if the declared type of the variable does not match the type of the assigned value
- This is a type declaration bug
- If bugs are not caught they'll cause runtime errors & crash the program

```shell
> error: incompatible types: String cannot be converted to int
>     int greeting = "Hello World";
```

> `Mess.java` will crash:

```java
public class Mess {
	public static void main(String[] args) {   
		String year = 2001;
    double title = "Shrek";
    int genre = 'C';
    boolean runtime = 1.58;
    char isPG = true;
	}
}
```

```shell
$ javac Mess.java
> Mess.java:3: error: incompatible types: int cannot be converted to String
>                 String year = 2001;
>                               ^
> Mess.java:4: error: incompatible types: String cannot be converted to double
>     double title = "Shrek";
>                    ^
> Mess.java:6: error: incompatible types: double cannot be converted to boolean
>     boolean runtime = 1.58;
>                       ^
> Mess.java:7: error: incompatible types: boolean cannot be converted to char
>     char isPG = true;
>                 ^
> 4 errors
$ 
```

> :pencil: Correct the variable types & recompile:

```java
public class Mess {
	public static void main(String[] args) {   
		int year = 2001;
    String title = "Shrek";
    char genre = 'C';
    double runtime = 1.58;
    boolean isPG = true;
	}
}
```

```shell
$ javac Mess.java
$
```

### Naming

- Valid variable names start with a _letter_, `$`, or `_`

> `BadNames.java` will error:

```java
public class BadNames {
	public static void main(String[] args) {   
		String 1stName = "Samira";
    String blah = "Smith";
    String .com = "samira@google.com";
    int salaryexpectation = 100000;
    int year_of_birth = 1955;
    
    System.out.println("The program runs!");
	}
}
```

```shell
> BadNames.java:3: error: not a statement
> 		String 1stName = "Samira";
> 		^
> BadNames.java:3: error: ';' expected
> 		String 1stName = "Samira";
> 		      ^
> 2 errors
```

> :pencil: Correct the bad names:

```java
public class BadNames {
	public static void main(String[] args) {   
		String firstName = "Samira";
    String lastName = "Smith";
    String emailAddress = "samira@google.com";
    int salaryExpectation = 100000;
    int birthYear = 1955;
    
    System.out.println("The program runs!");
	}
}
```

```shell
> The program runs!
```

### Variables Review

- `ints` store whole numbers
- `doubles` store bigger whole numbers and decimal numbers
- `booleans` store true and false
- `chars` store single characters using single quotes
- `Strings` store multiple characters using double quotes

- Static typing is one of the safety features of Java
- Java has naming conventions for variables

> :pencil: Create a very accurate job profile using different variable types:

```java
public class MyProfile {
	public static void main(String[] args) {   
		String name = "Ruth";
    int age = 99;
    double desiredSalary = 900000584008372.65;
    char gender = 'f';
    boolean lookingForJob = false;
	}
}
```
